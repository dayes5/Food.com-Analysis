# Recipes and Ratings from Food.com Analysis

## Introduction

Hello! 

Welcome to our Exploratory Data Analysis for a dataset taken from the reviews at [food.com](https://www.food.com). 

Food is an ever-present and often highly cherished part of our everyday lives. As our world becomes more interconnected, that also means delicious recipes–and thus food–can be widely shared. [Food.com](https://www.food.com) is a platform where users can share, rate, and review different recipes. 

For our EDA, we used data on both the ratings of each review from [food.com](https://www.food.com) and the information about the corresponding recipe. 

Although our dataset has 234,429 rows, or reviews from food.com users, it is only a subset of the data–from 2008 onwards–that was originally scraped and used by the authors from [here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/emnlp19c.pdf). 

For our analysis, we decided to ask: do dessert recipes tend to have more calories than other recipes?

We asked this question because we were interested in whether desserts, specifically, would have more calories than other recipes. Although desserts are typically seen as drastically more unhealthy than other recipes, we wanted to see if this was really the case on food.com. 

Our merged dataset (which combines recipe and rating information) contains these (especially) relevant columns: 

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `name` | Name of the recipe |
| `id` | A unique identifier for each recipe |
| `minutes` | The number of minutes it takes to prepare this recipe |
| `contributor_id` | A unique identifier for the contributor of the review |
| `tags` | A list of different tags that apply to this recipe |
| `nutrition`| Nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]. PDV stands for “percentage of daily value” |
| `n_steps` | The number of steps for this recipe |
| `description` | The user-provided description |
| `rating` | The rating given, out of a total of 5 |
| `review` | The text of the given review |
| `avg_rate` | The average rating for this recipe |

*Note*: In our data cleaning process, our `nutrition` column was later split into different columns. More relevant columns from this cleaned dataframe are listed here::

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `calories` | The number of calories for this recipe |
| `protein` | The PDV of protein for this recipe |

## Cleaning and EDA
 
### Data Cleaning

Our first step was to merge the recipes DataFrame, which contains information about things like a recipe’s ingredients and tags, with the interactions DataFrame, which contains information about things like reviews and ratings from different users.

While merging, we also filled all values of 0 in the `ratings` column with np.nan (not a value). On food.com, it is possible to post a review without leaving a star rating. We decided to fill in 0 ratings as missing, to account for everyone who may have posted without remembering to click on a star value, or didn’t know they had to click the stars to select their desired rating. In addition, many places often recognize 1, not 0, stars as the lowest rating. This way, people who forgot or did not know about the star rating feature also will not drag down the average rating. 

We then decided to find the average rating of each recipe, and added the information in a new column: `avg_rate`. We also changed the `submitted` and `date` columns from strings to datetime objects.

Next, we decided to separate the elements inside of the nutrition and tags for better readability and analysis potential. 

We used string methods to convert the data inside of the `nutrition`, `tags`, `steps`, and `ingredients` columns from a string of a list to an actual list.

In our merged dataframe, we exchanged the nutrition columns for columns such as `calories`, `total_fat`, etc., which correspond with the original values and units in the old nutrition lists. 

We decided to use one-hot encoding to flatten our tags data:

In this dataframe, 1 means the recipe contains the tag, while a 0 means the recipe does not.

Later on in our hypothesis test, we merge this tags dataframe with our main dataframe to analyze the relationship between certain recipe tags and their number of calories! 

As our cleaning came to a close, we did notice certain outliers, particularly for columns of interest such as `calories` and `sugar`. We decided to keep these in, as they were valid recipes but with larger servings/amounts of ingredients. 

Our final cleaned DataFrame looks like this:

I made my own chicken soup for this recipe. I was a bit worried about the tsp of soy sauce but it gave the casserole the best flavor.

Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.

### Univariate Graph EDA
<iframe src="assets/protien_univariate2.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Description and Trends: This is a graph that shows the recipes and their protein count. From the graph, we can quickly see that many recipes (about 43,000) have a protein amount between 0 to 4 PDV(Percent Daily Value) ; the distribution is right-skewed and we see a large decrease in the number of recipes following the initial peak. 

### Bivariate Graph EDA

<iframe src="assets/box_biivariate.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Description and Trends: This graph gives us a box plot, or a five summary set, for calories per rating. It tells us the minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, and maximum for calories within each ranking. Based on this graph, we can see that the median and the 1st quartile, or where the first 25% of the calorie values would lie, remains fairly consistent throughout each ranking. As the rating decreases, the 3rd quartile, or the value where 75% and less of the data lies, appears to increase in number of calories. The max calorie count is very variable throughout the rankings. 

### Aggregate Table

Significance: This pivot table gives us the average calories for each rating group and the number of ingredients used. This pivot table was created to see if there was any relation between recipes’ number of ingredients and ranking to its average calorie count. Based on the rankings and number of ingredients, we can see that there appears to be an increase in average calories as the number of ingredients increases for each ranking.  

## Assessment of Missingness

### NMAR ANALYSIS:

**What is NMAR?** 

NMAR or Not Missing at Random is a type of missingness mechanism that tells us that the data is missing due to values within itself, and not dependent on any other data in the dataset.

We believe that the 114 missing values in the `description` column of our dataset is Not Missing At Random (NMAR). We believe this because the description of a recipe does not really have any relation with other columns like `recipe_id`, `recipe_name`, or `n_steps`. In addition, the description may be missing depending on the actual description itself. For example, if the description would have been extremely short, since the recipe is self-explanatory or very widely known, users may have decided to exclude the description. If the user was lazy, and wanted to only write the bare minimum, they may have also decided to exclude a description. Because of the `description` column’s (logical) independence from the other columns in our DataFrame, and how the values of description itself may influence the missingness of the `description` column, we decided to categorize the `description` column as NMAR.

However, if we had other data that could explain the missingness of the `description` column, it could be then classified as MAR, or Missing at Random. Some data that might explain why the `description` column is perhaps how well-known the recipe, how simple the recipe is, and how complicated it would be to describe the recipe.

### MAR Permutation Tests

Another column that had missing values would be the `review` column. This column seems to contain a core purpose of using food.com (sharing opinions about a recipe), and we decided that this column may be MAR. Missing at Random (MAR) is a missingness mechanism where the missingness may be dependent on another column in the DataFrame. We used permutation tests to see which columns `rating` may have depended on. 

For our first permutation test, we decided to test whether the distribution of column `rating` when `review` is missing differs from the distribution of column `rating` when column `review` is not missing. This is because we reasoned that mediocre or higher ratings may have more missing reviews, since the rating itself was enough to account for their opinion. We used Total Variation Distance (TVD) as our test statistic, as we were dealing with two categorical variables. 

<iframe src="assets/bar_rating.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

**Empirical Distribution of TVD's**

<iframe src="assets/dist_tvd.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Our observed test statistic was about 0.02594. We got a p-value of 0.822. What this means in terms of our question is that we would fail to reject the null hypothesis. Our null hypothesis is that the distribution of `rating` when `review` is missing is the same as the distribution of `rating` when `review` is not missing. Since we got a p-value that was higher than 0.05, which was our threshold, we decided to fail to reject the null. This means that the missingness of reviews is not dependent on ratings.

**Difference in Group Means**

For our second permutation test, we decided to look at how the distribution of column `calories` when `review` is missing differs from the distribution of column `calories` when column `reviews` is not missing. Our null hypothesis is that the distribution of `review` when `calories` is missing is the same as the distribution of `review` when `calories` is not missing. We decided to use the difference in group means (distribution when `review` was missing - when `review` was not missing) as our test statistic, since `calories` is a quantitative variable. Here is a graph of our empirical distribution of group means:

<iframe src="assets/perm_cal.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Our observed test statistic was about 319.26908. We got a p-value of about 0.002, which was smaller than our significance level of 0.05. Since we got a p-value that was lower than 0.05, we decided to reject the null. This means that the missingness of reviews is dependent on the number of calories for that recipe.

## Hypothesis Testing 

Our question was: do dessert recipes tend to have more calories than other recipes?

Null Hypothesis: The recipes with the dessert tags have the same amount of calories as the recipes with other tags.

Alternative Hypothesis: The recipes with the dessert tags have higher amounts of calories than the recipes with other tags. 

Test statistic: Signed Difference of Means (between dessert recipes and overall recipes).
We chose to use this test statistic because our alternative hypothesis is directional, and we were dealing with quantitative variables (number of calories).

Observed Test Stat: 86.71038102803391

Significance Level: 0.05

P-Value: 0.493
A p-value is the likelihood of a sample drawn from the population having a test statistic that is more extreme than our observed value. Here, it seems our observed difference is not very large or unique, as under the null hypothesis.

<iframe src="assets/dist_hyp.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

**Conclusion**
We fail to reject the null hypothesis because our p-value of 0.493 is not significant–it is greater than our alpha value of 0.05. From our data, it appears that the recipes with the dessert tags do not have significantly more mean calories as the recipes with other tags. 


# Recipes and Food Calorie Prediction

## Framing the Problem

For our prediction problem, we decided to predict the number of calories for each recipe. This is a regression problem because calories is a continuous, quantitative variable. 

For our data cleaning, the process is detailed on [this website](https://nimenon24.github.io/Recipe-and-Ratings-from-Food.com-EDA/). The site also has our EDA.

Our response variable is the number of calories a recipe has. We chose calories because it has become one of the defining characteristics of a recipe or food, and we thought it would be interesting to see what other factors or nutrient qualities in food can influence calories. In addition, we have already started to explore it earlier in our EDA, and have a good familiarity of the variable. 

We chose to use R^2 as our metric, since we are using a regression model. R^2 is the proportion of the variance in the response variable that is explained by the predictor variables, and since that is between 0 and 1, we thought it was easier to understand and work with. In addition, it is not dependent on sample size or range like root mean squared error is. 

At the current time, we know the features that were given to us in the data frames that we had merged together from Food.com. Some of these features include nutrients, minutes, and number of steps. We can use some of these features in our prediction as the date for all these recipes have come before 2022. 


## Baseline Model


We decided to use a linear regression model as our baseline model. The features we chose were `carbohydrates`, `protein`, and `n_ingredients`. 

In our baseline model, we have 2 continuous quantitative variables: `protein` and `carbohydrates`. We also have 1 discrete quantitative variable, `n_ingredients`. 

When we plotted `protein` and `calories`, as well as `carbohydrates` and `calories`, we saw that the relationship seemed to appear linear and was positive. Protein and carbohydrates are also things that are typically positively correlated with calories. `n_ingredients` also made sense for us to include, since the more ingredients, the more calories there typically are.

<iframe src="assets/protein_cal.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

<iframe src="assets/carbs_cal.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

The performance of our model had an R^2 value of 0.8025781014688295. Based on this score, this suggests that our model is pretty “good” in predicting a linear relationship. We decided this because our score for R^2 is fairly close to 1, which is where the R^2 score tells us that it is a good linear fit. 


## Final Model

When we were building upon our baseline model, we decided to include all variables that could influence the number of calories for a food. We decided to include `sugar`, `total fat`, and `rating` (in addition to our original `carbohydrates`, `protein`, and `n_ingredients`).

We included these because we thought that they also influenced the calorie content of each recipe, in the case of `sugar` and `total fat`, or could provide us a hint in regards to how good it tasted (as in the case of `rating`). Typically, as fat and sugar increase, so does the number of calories in a recipe–they are positively correlated. We also thought that higher tastiness could mean that the recipe had a higher calorie content.

We decided to transform sugar by using the StandardScalar transformer as we wanted to make sure that the measurements were contributing equally and were on the same scale to make a fair prediction later on. 

We decided to use the QuantileTransformer on total fat as our distribution was right-skewed, and we wanted to spread out very common fat values. The QuantileTransformer would allow us to do this as it would transform the feature into a uniform distribution. 

For `rating`, we decided to use one-hot encoding because it was a categorical variable. 

We tried three different regression models: linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. For each model, we tried different combinations of our features, and passed the rest of the variables through. Then, we found the average R^2 value across all folds for each combination.

Linear regression combinations and their mean R^2 values across all folds:

| Factor Combination                          | Means    |
|:--------------------------------------------|---------:|
| quant fat + quant sugar                     | 0.839824 |
| quant fat + std sugar                       | 0.84275  |
| quant fat + std sugar + rating              | 0.84276  |
| quant fat + quant carb + std sugar + rating | 0.772188 |
| all                                         | 0.758055 |


Decision Tree combinations and their mean R^2 values across all folds:

| Factor Combination                          | Means    |
|:--------------------------------------------|---------:|
| quant fat + quant sugar                     | 0.969414 |
| quant fat + std sugar                       | 0.97254  |
| quant fat + std sugar + rating              | 0.96695  |
| quant fat + quant carb + std sugar + rating | 0.975035 |
| all                                         | 0.973825 |


Random Forest combinations and their mean R^2 values across all folds:

| Factor Combination                          | Means    |
|:--------------------------------------------|---------:|
| quant fat + quant sugar                     | 0.965452 |
| quant fat + std sugar                       | 0.967322 |
| quant fat + std sugar + rating              | 0.963469 |
| quant fat + quant carb + std sugar + rating | 0.965212 |
| all                                         | 0.966005 |

Here, “quant” refers to how we used a Quantile Transformer for those factors. “std” means that the variable was transformed using a Standard Scaler, and we one-hot encoded rating. “all” meant that we had `rating` one-hot encoded, `sugar` transformed with Standard Scaler, and `total fat`, `protein`, and `n_ingredients` transformed with Quantile Transformer.

We found the optimal combination to be using total fat (with Quantile Transformer) and sugar (with Standard Scaler). Although our Decision Tree Regressor with all variables (Standard Scaler for sugar, and Quantile Transformer for `total fat`, `protein`, and `n_ingredients`) had a higher score, we decided to go with the simpler model since the difference was quite small–only around 0.01.

After we found the optimal combination, we then used `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters (such as maximum depth and the minimum sample size) for our Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressions. 

After we applied train test split, we found the following training and test R^2 scores for each model:

Linear Regression: 
Training: 0.8480349912087494
Testing: 0.8347615240995385

Our best Decision Tree, with `max_depth= None` and `min_samples_split = 2`: 
Training: 0.9993726305010362
Testing: 0.9667203773211627

Our best Random Forest, with parameters `max_depth = 7`, `min_samples_split = 3`, and `n_estimators = 7`: 
Training: 0.9835020497209663
Testing: 0.9791101623648127

We found that using a decision tree regression, with parameters `max_depth= None` and `min_samples_split = 2`, yielded the highest R^2 values for both our training and test dataset. 


## Fairness Analysis

We decided to explore if our model performed similarly for dessert recipes and non-dessert recipes. 

For our evaluation metric, we decide to continue to use R^2.

Our null hypothesis was:
The model's score is the same for both dessert recipes and non-dessert recipes, and any differences are due to chance.

Our alternative hypothesis was: 
The model's score is higher for dessert recipes.

Our test statistic was the difference in R^2 scores (dessert - non-dessert), and we got around 0.00832 for our observed statistic. 

Our significance level was 0.01. Our resulting p-value was very close to 0, which is significant. 

This means that our model appears to not be fair when looking at its performance between dessert recipes and non-dessert recipes; we can say with 99% confidence that our model does a better job predicting the number of calories for dessert recipes than for non-dessert recipes.
